This program is meant to allow anyone to send messages to a system running an HTTP web socket, and output audio through that machine.
I am running this locally and port forwarding localhost:80 through ngrok.exe to avoid port forwarding my router.

It also features a word filter that is configurable to you, allowing you to add a banned words list of words you want the speaker to ignore.
Every removed word is replaced by "REMOVED" when the message is spoken aloud.
